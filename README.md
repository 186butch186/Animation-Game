# Animation-Game
Project Name:  Stickman Adventure Game
	Software Used: Java, Stylze (Animation Software), Eclipse
Main Objective/Function: I developed a stick figure side scroller animation game in Java. This game included collision 
detection, Keyboard events, and draw functions, as well as basic enemy A.I that would traverse the map and attack the 
player when they encounter him. I also used a program called “Stylze” to develop in game sprites to create my own 
custom characters.
